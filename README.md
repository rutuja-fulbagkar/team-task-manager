# team-task-manager
Build a lightweight task management application where teams can create projects, add tasks, assign members, and update task statuses. The goal is to evaluate your ability to work across the full stack: frontend (React/Next + Redux/Context), backend (Node.js + Express), database (MongoDB/MySQL), and deployment.


This repository contains a full-stack task management app (React + Node + MongoDB).
