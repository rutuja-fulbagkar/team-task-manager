üìù Assumptions and Decisions
Only project owners can add/remove members; access is role-based.

All authentication and user-sensitive operations are protected with JWT tokens.

Task and project Kanban are available to members of each project only.

Email-based OTP is required for verification and password reset flows.

Application follows a strict separation between presentational and logic components for maintainability.

All state is managed with Redux Toolkit and persisted for smooth UX.
